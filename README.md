# greenergy

Program was made in Spyder. 

Test cases

1, For the testing I downloaded the pytest for it. Used the Anaconda prompt to do it

conda install pytest

2, To use the in Spyder enviroment you need to click on the run tab on the top of the screen and look for run unit tests

3, Choose pytest, and the working directory of the files

Running the application should be doable with the scripts. First of all you need to build it with the build.sh. After that the docker could be started with the start.sh and could be stopped with the stop.sh file. If those scripts are not working as last resort you can import into any IDE or run with CLI. Also all need to be in the same working folder.
